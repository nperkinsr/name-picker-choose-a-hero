# Name picker: Choose a hero
**Name Picker: Choose a Hero** is a whimsical name picker project where a random hero is selected from a list of names you provide. This project was created to practise working with JSON and revisit the logic behind random selection.

Upon clicking the **Choose new hero** button, the story unfolds dramatically with timed text animations:

+ A name begins to form...
+ The new hero has been chosen. Their role has been assigned.
+ They are {adjective} {type} {quirk}
  
_(e.g. a jealous jaffa cake defender who replaces all nouns with the word “banana”)_
+ The world will be saved by: {chosenName}, {title}
  
_(e.g. Charles, the One with the Good Biscuits)_

The random elements (adjective, type, quirk, and title) are pulled from different arrays in a JSON file, offering an endless mix of weird and hilarious hero descriptions.

This project focuses on:
+ Handling and accessing external JSON data
+ Random selection from multiple arrays
+ Timed animations and sequential text reveals
+ Injecting personality and humour into the UI
